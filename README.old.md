### Assignment: Creating a To-Do List Application

### Theory:

In this assignment, you will create a simple web application to manage a task list. This application will consist of the following components and functionality:

### `App component` :
The main component of the application, which contains a list of tasks and a form to add new tasks.
TaskList component: A component that displays a list of tasks.
### `Task component`: 
A component that represents an individual task.
Form for adding tasks: The user should be able to add new tasks through the form.
Mark tasks as completed: The user can mark tasks as completed or unmark them.
Delete tasks: The user can delete tasks from the list.

### Practice:

Create a new React application using create-react-app.
Create `App`, `TaskList`, and `Task components`.
In the `App` component, create a state to store a list of tasks. Each task should have a unique identifier, task text, and a flag that indicates whether the task is completed.
Create a form in the `App` component to add new tasks.
Implement logic to add new tasks to the list.
Implement logic to mark a task as completed or unmark it.
Implement logic to remove a task from the list.
Display the task list in the TaskList component, using `Task` components to display individual tasks.
Style the application using `CSS` or a style library of your choice.
Run the application and test its performance.
This assignment will allow you to dive deeper into React and understand how to work with components, state, and events. Also, you will learn how to manage data and interface in real time.
